# @mathias 's public project archive

I wanted to have permalinks to point to, and be able to log various Issues towards, any projects I am working on in my free time. These could be software or hardware -- really anything I am tinkering with.

Keeping all the links and specs in one place should also help me in the future to remember what I've got and how I planned to use it.

## Projects
Projects are now tracked in [Issues](https://github.com/mathias/projects/issues) in this repo.
