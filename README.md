# @mathias 's public project archive

I wanted to have permalinks to point to, and be able to log various Issues towards, any projects I am working on in my free time. These could be software or hardware -- really anything I am tinkering with.

Keeping all the links and specs in one place should also help me in the future to remember what I've got and how I planned to use it.

## Projects
Projects are now tracked in Issues in this repo. 

## Low-power ARM NAS (Network Attached Storage)

I am using a [RockPro64 board](https://www.pine64.org/rockpro64/), a SATA riser, and a [hot swap SATA cage](https://www.rosewill.com/rosewill-rsv-sata-cage-34-hard-disk-drive-cage/p/9SIA072GJ92556) to build a small, low-power NAS box.

**Current status**: canceled due to power issues for powering both HDDs and the RockPro64 board.
