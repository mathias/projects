# @mathias 's public project archive

I wanted to have permalinks to point to, and be able to log various Issues towards, any projects I am working on in my free time. These could be software or hardware -- really anything I am tinkering with.

Keeping all the links and specs in one place should also help me in the future to remember what I've got and how I planned to use it.

## Solar garage

Hardware:
* 2 [Renogy 100 watt solar panels](https://www.renogy.com/100-watt-12-volt-monocrystalline-solar-panel-compact-design/)
* 1 [Renogy 40A MPPT charge controller](https://www.renogy.com/rover-li-40-amp-mppt-solar-charge-controller/)
* 1 [Renogy cable kit, 20ft](https://www.amazon.com/Renogy-Accessory-Systems-Kit-Connector/dp/B091KTG9WX/) (includes Z-brackets)
* 1 [Renogy Deep Cycle AGM Battery 12 Volt 200Ah](https://www.renogy.com/deep-cycle-agm-battery-12-volt-200ah/)
* 1 [Renogy 2000W 12V Pure Sine Wave Inverter](https://www.renogy.com/2000w-12v-pure-sine-wave-inverter/)

Planning to grow to double the panels and another battery, eventually.

### Project log

## Solar webserver project
* 1 spare UPS battery (unbranded), 9Ah. 
* 1 [MPPT Solar Charger for intelligent devices](https://www.tindie.com/products/globoy/mppt-solar-charger-for-intelligent-devices/) - again, likely for a solar webserver. 

Inspired by getting the spare UPS battery which didn't fit my UPS. I could not return it, so why not move my "personal cloud" Raspberry Pi to solar power and a battery? I don't use the RPi much at night anyways.
